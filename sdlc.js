// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Implementation 4 
// Design 3 
// Maintain 6
// Analysis of Requirements 2 
// Testing & Integration 5 
// Planning    1 


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
let AnalysisOfRequirments = "second step, where the needs of modules, libraries and resources are stated."
let Design = "third step, time to think about what functions are going to be most effective to get the project done and what practices will work best in the program"
let Implementation = "fourth step, put your planning and design to the drawing board and start writing the stack"
let Testing_intergration = "fifth step, see how your design is working by testing variables and extensivley look for possible errors and clean code if needed."
const Maintain = "sixth and last step, now that your program runs effectivley, the work does not stop. Debugging the program wil follow, along with making minor changes as needed."
